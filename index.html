            <p><small>WOW!</small><em>My first web page let's go!</em></p>
            <p style="color:orange;"> Hello, I'm Popoola Ridwan Dolapo, a student at the Polytechnic Ibadan in the Faculty of Financial Management Studies, Accountancy Department, currently in my second year of HND.
                 <br>I come from a humble background, being one of five siblings, <br>so I really understand the value of hard work from a young age. Football is my hoppy and <br>I love to keep it real at all times.
                  I'm not just focused on my professional course; <br>Iâ€™m always eager to learn new skills to help me make some money and achieve my dreams. <br>School life has been an amazing adventure, and I hope to finish strong.
                   Thanks for joining me on this journey!</p>
